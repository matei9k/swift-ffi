</div>

## Building & Running

```bash
$ swift run
```
This command assumes you have the Swift toolchain installed. After you execute it, the program will automatically run.


## Usage
When you run the binary, you will be asked to enter 2 numbers.  
After the 2 numbers are gathered, Swift will call the C function to add them, showing the result on the screen.
